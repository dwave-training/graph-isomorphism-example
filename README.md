# Graph Isomorphism
The [Graph Isomorphism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_isomorphism) problem asks whether two given graphs
are isomorphic, that is, if a bijection (one-to-one mapping) of vertices between the graphs exists such that
the adjacency structure is preserved.

# Set up your environment
In a fresh environment, run:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

# Usage
To run this demo, open up Jupyter Lab with a terminal.
Run this command:
```
jupyter lab
```

In Jupyter Lab, you can open the notebook and run the code on your local machine.

Using the IDE is another option, if you'd like to try, right click the notebook and select "Open in Notebook Editor".

# Code Overview
The notebook provided covers encoding the objective and constraints of the Graph Isomorphism problem
with our open source D-Wave Ocean tools.
